Intuitive, attractive logger for Node.js applications based on [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston).

This module was built and is maintained by the [Roosevelt web framework](https://rooseveltframework.org) [team](https://rooseveltframework.org/contributors), but it can be used independently of Roosevelt as well.
